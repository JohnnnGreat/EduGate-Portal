# Building an Experimental Web App

Here's how it all started...

=====================================

I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree, and during my time at university, I faced one major issue that kept popping up: where’s the central hub for everything?! I needed a reliable place to access all the information related to my studies. I’m talking about a smooth admission system, a place to check my sessions payments, a support center for raising and tracking tickets, getting connection and networking’s, and a way to provide feedback when needed. But unfortunately, my university was still relying on a lot of manual processes for things like registration. It felt like we were trying to move forward with outdated systems when technology had already progressed so much. Oh, and don’t even get me started on the library—there was no accessible platform where students could easily get all the info they needed at their convenience.

The current university portal was also a big part of the problem. Navigating it felt more like a chore than an efficient experience. The layout was confusing, and finding important information like took longer than it should. On top of that, it wasn’t very user-friendly—slow loading times, unclear navigation, and no real-time support for students. If you had an issue, you were left with emailing someone and hoping for a response, which wasn’t always timely. All in all, the portal just didn’t feel modern or student-focused.

Let’s just say, I never had a memorable experience using the portal. But now that I’m officially a graduate, I thought: What if I could build something way more reliable? Something with a sleek UI, just like those modern university portals we see in the Western world. That’s when the idea of creating an experimental project hit me. Not just another school project, but a user dashboard and an admin dashboard that could handle the entire management of a university. Think of it as a prototype that any university (including mine, or any other Nigerian university) could look at and think, “Hey, this could work for us!”

# So what’s this project all about?
If you’re into tech like I am, you’ll probably agree that good UI design matters. A fast website, smooth interactions, and a clean experience are what keep users engaged, right? That’s exactly my drive for this project. I started with ideation (thinking through the concept), then moved to design, and now, I’m diving into development. It’s all part of the journey. I’ve mentioned it’s an experimental project, and because it’s so ambitious, I don’t have a clear plan to finish the entire website just yet.

# Now let’s talk about the stack!
There are tons of tech stacks out there, but I decided to go with Next.js, Express, and Mongoose. It’s a bit unconventional, but it’s been a lot of fun. Want a sneak peek? Check out my Figma file link and see it for yourself. Take a look and let me know what you think!

That’s the story for now. Oh, and the GitHub is live too!
